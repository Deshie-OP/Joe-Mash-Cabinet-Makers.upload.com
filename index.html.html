        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            We buy woods from different companies based in Silverton but mostly we buy by <b>Cut N Edge</b> as we got the best services and woods from them. 
            Our first course of action is taking pictures before build-in and after build-in. 
            Starting with assembling, moving on to the placement of the carboard size by size where it belongs, only once assembling is completed. 
            We than start placing them on the walls, starting from the bottom carboard first, then moving up with the top carboards, and therefore measuring first and correctly is extremely important to us. 
            We always check the quality of the woods first before assembling as we want to give the best results possible.
